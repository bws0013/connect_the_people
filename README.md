### Mapping Relationships Between People

 - Dependency alert: go get github.com/Jeffail/gabs

##### Idea #####

I want to make a tool that can be used by non-programmers who have ideas for some kind of social network. This will allow them map out the network in advance to see if its is differentiable from things that already exist.

My central idea is that networks are always just collections of profiles. It is always some element of these profiles that people want to change.


##### A little more abstract #####

A graph in which all points have a relationship to one central point and may also have relationships with other points on the graph.

Currently I want to make all of those points people. A sort of meta social network, without any of the social. Just information about people and their relationships to others.

##### A little less abstract #####

I want to bring the magic of json to the everyone
